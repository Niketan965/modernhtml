        <p>HTML5 is the fifth major revision of the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) standard, and it introduced several significant changes and improvements compared to its predecessor, HTML4. Here are five key differences between HTML and HTML5:</p>

                <td> <li> HTML4 had a limited set of semantic elements like div, span, and generic heading tags (h1, h2, etc.)</li></td>
                <td><li>HTML5 introduced a rich set of semantic elements such as header, nav>, main>, article>, section>, footer>, and more. These elements provide a more structured way to define the meaning and purpose of different parts of a web page, improving both accessibility and document structure.</li></td>

                <td><li>HTML5 introduced native support for multimedia content with the audio and video elements. This eliminates the need for plugins and provides a standardized way to embed and control audio and video content directly in web pages.</li></td>

                <td>
                    <li>HTML5 introduced the canvas element, which provides a drawing surface for creating 2D graphics, animations, and interactive visualizations using JavaScript. This feature is particularly useful for web-based games and data visualization.

                <td>
                    <li>HTML5 introduced new form input types (e.g., type="email", type="date") and attributes (e.g., required, pattern) that simplify form validation, improve user experience, and enable better input control.</li>

                    <li>HTML5 introduced technologies like the Application Cache and the Service Worker API, which enable web applications to work offline, cache resources, and provide better performance even when the user is not connected to the internet.</li>
